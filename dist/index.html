        <div class="about__intro">
            <p class="about__text1">From designing and planning video game stages I wish existed, to developing skills
                in
                martial arts
                that
                eventually led me to get my black belt, my childhood consisted of displaying my creativity. I continued
                to
                express this in high school where I was exposed to a technological design course and solved
                multidisciplinary problems using advanced technology. Above all, this course helped to elucidate that
                technology has a major impact on our lives and in the world around us. Knowing that I could use these
                skills
                to confer societal benefits, it became apparent that I wanted to pursue a career in this direction. From
                that point forward, I began my journey of becoming an engineer.</p>

            Being a Systems Design Engineer student allows me to explore a variety of
            engineering topics. This enables me to to satisfy my own curiosity as I tend to learn new skills whenever
            possible. Whether that be during co-op terms where I work in a professional environment for four months, or
            while taking complex engineering courses in university, I always try to find ways to explore technologies
            and
            skills that I am interested in. Below are some of the skills that I have developed throughout my engineering
            journey thus far as well as my past work experiences.

                    <ul>
                        <li>In my recent co-op position I tested and troubleshot my company's payment processing API
                            that was integrated
                            on merchant's web/mobile applications</li>
                        <li>To expedite the end-to-end integration of our API product onto native apps, I introduced a
                            mobile
                            emulator tool used for functional testing and standardized an API test guideline</li>
                        <li>Wanting to further improve our API, I collaborated cross-functionally with the development
                            and QA
                            team

                            in the API parameters</li>
                        <li>I also generated reports using SQL in the staging database with over 100 million records;
                            these
                            displayed

                        <li>In my first co-op position, I collected data to accellerate a $140-million nuclear project
                            which involved shifting 480 fuel channels in Bruce Power's unit 3
                            nuclear reactor</li>
                        <li>To expedite and enhance the data collection process, I developed the software that tracked,
                            transferred and computed data through databases to resolve multiple technical issues and
                            double the process speed of data computation</li>
                        <li>I also designed a logbook which
                            accumulated updates on the progress of every fuel channel being shifted and any potential
                            hazards within
                            the training facility</li>
                        <li>This ensured that the upcoming day/night shift understood which data needed to be collected
                            and also provided
                            the project managers with a history of past events</li>
